- *Leave Request*: Tracks employee leave requests and their status.

## Data Model

### Key Custom Objects

- *Employee*: Stores employee data, including personal information, employment history, department, and role.
- *Leave Request*: Tracks leave requests, including leave type, dates, and status.
- *Attendance Log*: Stores clock-in/out times, work hours, and attendance status.
- *Performance Review*: Stores performance evaluations, goals, and feedback.
- *Shift Schedule*: Tracks employee work schedules, including shift times and availability.

### Relationships

- An *Employee* can have multiple *Leave Requests*.
- An *Employee* can have multiple *Attendance Logs*.
- An *Employee* can have multiple *Performance Reviews*.
- An *Employee* can be scheduled for multiple *Shift Schedules*.

## Customizations

- *Custom Lightning Pages*: Tailored page layouts for employee profiles, leave requests, and attendance logs.

- *Validation Rules*: Enforce business logic and data integrity for employee records, leave requests, and attendance.

## How It Works

1. *Employee Profile Management*: Employees are added to Salesforce as records within the **Employee* custom object. HR staff can edit and update employee information as needed.

2. *Leave Request Process*: Employees submit leave requests through a custom interface. The leave request goes through an approval workflow, which HR staff or managers can approve or deny.

3. *Attendance Tracking*: Employee attendance is logged either manually or through an integrated time tracking system. Attendance logs are automatically updated with clock-in/out times and hours worked.

4. *Performance Reviews*: Employees are evaluated periodically using the **Performance Review* object. Feedback is collected from both employees and managers.

5. *Shift Scheduling*: HR managers create and manage employee shift schedules. The system automatically checks for scheduling conflicts and sends reminders.

6. *Analytics & Reporting*: HR teams can generate reports and dashboards based on employee performance, attendance, and leave data. These insights help to improve workforce efficiency and engagement.
